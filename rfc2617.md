# [RFC 2617] HTTP Authentication 

## Section 1.2 - Access Authentication Framework

#### BNF
```
auth-scheme    = token
auth-param     = token "=" ( token | quoted-string )
challenge   = auth-scheme 1*SP 1#auth-param
realm       = "realm" "=" realm-value
realm-value = quoted-string
credentials = auth-scheme #auth-param
```

#### Summary
- If the server does not accept the credentials, 401 response is **RECOMMENDED**.
- 401 response **MUST** include WWW-Authenticate `header`.
- `WWW-Authenticate` MUST contain at least one challenge.
- `realm` is **REQUIRED** for all challenges.
- `realm` + root URL defines the protection space.
- User agent **MUST** choose the strongest auth-scheme.

## Section 2 - Basic Authentication Scheme

#### BNF
```
challenge   = "Basic" realm
credentials = "Basic" basic-credentials
basic-credentials = base64-user-pass
base64-user-pass  = <base64 [4] encoding of user-pass, except not limited to 76 char/line>
user-pass   = userid ":" password
userid      = *<TEXT excluding ":">
password    = *TEXT
```

#### Summary 
- This scheme **MUST** have an user-ID and a password.
- Is **RECOMMENDED** that clients assume that all paths at or deeper than the last element in the path field of Request-URI are within the same protection space specified by the `realm` value of the challenge.
- After authenticated, client **MAY** preemptively send the `Authorization` header to same realm space without receive a challenge.
